# React-Project

This project is a simple quiz application built using React. It allows users to take a quiz consisting of multiple-choice questions. The questions and options are fetched from a static dataset stored in the data.js file.

The application tracks the user's progress, displaying the current question number out of the total number of questions. Users can select an option for each question, and upon selection, the application checks if the chosen answer is correct.

Once the user completes the quiz, their score is displayed, along with an option to reset the quiz and start over. The application provides a straightforward and interactive way for users to test their knowledge on a specific topic.
